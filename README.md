QChatbot is a simple web app built with Streamlit that lets you ask questions and get answers from Google’s Gemini 1.5 language model.
It uses environment variables to keep your API key safe.
The app streams responses in real-time as you type your questions.
It remembers the entire chat history during your session so you can see past questions and answers.

1.INSTALL PACKAGES
To use it, install Python packages like Streamlit, python-dotenv, and google-generativeai.


2.ADD YOUR GOOGLE API KEY
Add your Google API key to a .env file.

3.RUN THE APP

This project is great for anyone who wants to try out Google’s powerful AI models in a simple chat interface.
